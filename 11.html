           Initially, I was quite confused by both of these concepts, especially digital logic circuits because of other intricacies, but as I practiced and asked more questions my understanding improved. And even better, my overall interest in engineering and computer science increased.

        <p class= "Thoughts"> This is my last project of my 11th grade semester. I worked over the couse of 3 weeks to design these chess pieces. If you couldn't tell these pieces are heavily inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender, which is one of my favorite TV shows. The chess peices represent Aang, Momo, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko, who represent the Air, Water, Earth, and Fire Nations respectively.

           This was a great learning experience for me about how important it is for me to vocalize my thoughts and opinions because my lack of them almost cost my group our project. One of my team members kept trying to perfect the car, but they tampered with it to the point where it stop working completely, but if I had said something there could have been a different outcome.
