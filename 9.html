          While this is just a picture of the materials used in the project, I did actually create something. I created a quilt square with my novice sewing machine experience. This project encouraged me to use my basement-ridden sewing machine, which ultimately sparked my interest in sewing as a hobby. So, if you need a scrunchie any time soon, make sure to message me!

           This was an interesting project that served as my introduction to actual 3D-printing and actually utilizing CAD software. It was an engaging experience because I got to work with my friends to construct an item basically from scratch only using computer-aided designs and measurements.

           Throughout freshman year I had worked on CAD software which is used to 3D print and design skematics for projects. In the beginning using this software was quite difficult for me, but I eventually got better by really more on my peers and external resources for help.
