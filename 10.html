         <p class= "Eng"> Geodesic Dome Project </p>
         <img class= "EngPics" id="geodesic" src="https://www.igreenspot.com/wp-content/uploads/geodesic-dome-house1.jpg"

         <p class= "Thoughts">
           Although this is not a picture of the project, this is one of the main inspiration of the project. This was the last project that I had completed for engineering before the COVID-19 pandemic. I was in a team of four and involved a tedious amount of hot glue, plexiglass, and cardboard. It was a stressful project to do but it was worth all of the stress when my team got extra credit for holding up 20 lbs (which we were quite surprised by).

         <p class= "Eng"> Balloon Car Project </p>
         <img class= "EngPics" src="aassets/josh.jpg"
         alt= "A cardboard car attached to a straw-balloon complex.">
         <img class="EngPics" src="aassets/3Dcar.jpg" alt="A computer aided design of a car with a balloon and straw attached."
         <br>
         <p class= "Thoughts">
           This was a great learning experience for me about how important it is for me to vocalize my thoughts and opinions because my lack of them almost cost my group our project. One of my team members kept trying to perfect the car, but they tampered with it to the point where it stop working completely, but if I had said something there could have been a different outcome.

         <p class= "Eng"> Conveyor Belt Project </p>

         <br>
         <p class= "Thoughts">
           In this project, I worked with three of my friends to create a conveyor belt that can separate Valentine's day candy, such as Kisses and Sweethearts.
