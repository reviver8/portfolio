          Throughout my high school career, I have participated in a STEM program at my school. By being in this program I have gotten the chance to learn about the applicability of STEM, specifically engineering and programming, to other industries and fields.

          Although I only joined HOSA in my sophmore year which eventually turned into a world of virtual learning, through HOSA I was able to discover more about myself and the medical field. By testing in HOSA and frequently attending guest speakers and information meetings, I have gotten the chance to further my interest in the medical field and foster my interest in biotechnology and culturally competent healthcare.
